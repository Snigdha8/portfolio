    "about": "I am a Computer Science graduate student at Stony Brook University, set to graduate in May 2025. Prior to this, I worked as a Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments for 3 years. I have completed my Bachelor's in CS from NIT Nagpur, India, with a strong foundation in CS topics such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Databases, Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, Object-oriented programming (OOP), Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD), Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science. Currently, I'm exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced topics in Operating Systems.\n I am detail-oriented, quick to learn, and adaptable, always striving to give my utmost effort in everything I do. What motivates me each morning is drawing inspiration from those around me, making a meaningful impact, and serving as an inspiration to others, both personally and professionally. Beyond the realm of technology, I find joy in hobbies such as cycling, walking, immersing myself in nature, painting, and photography.\n I'll leave you with a line I read in a book - 'Everyone who got to where they are had to begin where they were.'",
